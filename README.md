# OncoSharp
**OncoSharp** is a modular C# library for radiation oncology research and development, with a strong focus on **dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis** and **biologically informed treatment modeling**.

It provides robust support for key radiotherapy quantities including:

- 📦 **Volume**
- 🎯 **Physical dose**
- ⚗️ **Radiobiological dose (e.g., EQD2, EQD0, BED)**
- 🧬 **Tumor cell density**
- 🔬 **PET tracer activity**

Built for high-performance and extensibility, OncoSharp includes tools to compute:

- 📊 **Cumulative and differential DVHs**
- 📈 **Tumor Control Probability (TCP)**
- 📉 **Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)**

The library is ideal for advanced treatment evaluation, radiobiological plan optimization, and developing next-generation clinical decision-support tools in radiotherapy.

## 📦 Use Cases

- Radiation oncology research and academic prototyping
- Development of QA tools for RT planning and evaluation
- Clinical plan comparison and DVH-based analysis
- Integration into larger medical imaging or planning systems
- TCP and NTCP modeling
